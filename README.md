## Course Description
There are many cognitive tasks that are simple for the human, but very difficult for the computer. Artificial intelligence (AI) tries to solve these kind of problems. Traditional approach to AI is based on symbolic knowledge representation and reasoning as symbol manipulation. Biologically inspired connectivistic approach simulates cognitive abilities of the brain. The aim of the course is to introduce different AI approaches and to give an overview AI methods, including methods for knowledge representation, automatic reasoning, problem solving, learning, and optimization.
